# Build A Movie Review App With Rails
> I built a movie rating and review application.
> We have a bunch of different movies and each movie has multiple review which is rated on a one to five star scale. And then another cool feature is we have the ability to search.
> The cool thing about this search gem that we are using is it's able to distinguish between correct spelling and misspelled or pluralization and all that.
> And obviouly we have the ability to sign-up/sign-in, and only sign-in users have the ability to write review.
